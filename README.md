Just finished watching Flight Risk, dude. Let me tell you, it was a whole trip. Seriously, what was even happening half the time? Like, I get it’s supposed to be this intense thriller, but I was just sitting there kinda lost, you know what I mean? The way they just threw you into the middle of everything, it was like, Okay, guess I’ll download the movie again just to catch up.

> There were moments, though, where I was like, Wow, didn’t see that coming! But also, half the time I’m thinking, “Why is this character doing this dumb thing again?” Everybody’s just running around, making bad decisions left and right, which is great for the drama but holy moly, calm down a bit, maybe?

And can we talk about the lead dude? He’s kinda all over the place. One second he’s this hero guy, the next he’s just messing everything up, and you’re wondering, Should I be rooting for this guy or just facepalming?

For real, though, the soundtrack slapped. That’s one thing that kept me going till the end with it. And oh yeah, the way they shot that last scene — wild! I honestly thought, “Okay, now I gotta watch the movie again, just for that.” Whoever directed this has some serious guts, I guess.

#include <iostream> // lol, what am I even doing with this?

Anyway, I’m still processing the whole thing. It's like my brain is in twelve different places. But hey, we should plan a hangout soon and watch something that's like, less mind-boggling and more chill? Up for it?
